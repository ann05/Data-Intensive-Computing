This project aims to implement data analysis algorithms such as Linear Regression, k-means and knn clustering algorithm.

Activities:

Lab3_1.ipynb:  analyzes landdata-states.csv and uses ggplot2 to visualize Linear Model trained on the data. This is a sample LM and ggplot2 tutorial to get to know the commands.

Lab3_2.ipynb: is a tutorial on k-mean clustering using Iris dataset. This dataset is present in R by default.

Lab3_3.ipynb: is a worked out example on customer data obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository which uses k-means clustering and handles the outliers and output clusters.

Lab3_Activity1.ipynb is a linear model task that trains NHL Top 100 players data using a linear model (lm) and visualizes the model using slope and intercept obtained from the model. The desciption of various plots in the R notebook are given below each plot for understanding.

Lab3_Activity2.ipynb is a knn task that shows the variation of mis-classification rate for different set of k values on german credit data.

Lab3_Activity3.ipynb is a k-means implementation that plots a graph for each set of clusters on various columns taken from the dataset about social issues from Pew Research Center.
